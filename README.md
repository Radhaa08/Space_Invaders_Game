## What are Shmup Game? 
A "shoot 'em up", also known as a "shmup" or "STG" (the common Japanese abbreviation for "shooting games"), is a game in which the protagonist combats a large number of enemies by shooting at them while dodging their fire. The controlling player must rely primarily on reaction times to succeed.

## Why did we chose this project?
Our aim is to explore the intersection of game development and programming by creating a shmup game using C\# and Unity, fostering hands-on learning, and developing problem-solving skills. We delve into game design principles, C\# scripting, and Unity's features to create an engaging gaming experience.

After trying to create a Space Invaders game in Unity, we decided to further enhance our learning by recreating the game using Pygame, a popular game development library in Python. This exercise helps in understanding different game development frameworks and reinforces the core concepts of game programming and OOP.
